PacMan moves across the screen back and forth to demonstrate basic edge detection

Instalation: Drop the folder into your file management system and drag and drop the index.html into a blank browser

Usage: Simple animation displays in the browser. Could be used to help understand simple edge detection JavaScript code

Support: Documentation on MDN and forums on stackOverflow describe similar animations with different approaches.

RoadMap: This could be used as a base to further develop animations that move in other axis and with other behaviours using this as a template to start with.
